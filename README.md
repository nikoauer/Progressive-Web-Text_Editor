# Progressive Web Text Editor

## Description

This text editor has been modified in order to make it more of PWA. This was a challenging exercise in attempting to better understand how a site can operate offline, retain a less intensive script of the site for poorer internet connections and to also allow the site to be downloadable. 

## Installation

In order to install this project, first download or fork the repository. 

User will require access to node.js and must download all npm package dependencies. This can be done by typing in npm install in the terminal window of the project within your code editor.  

## Usage

Once all dependencies have been installed and node.js is installed in your terminal window you can simply type npm run start to start the program and it should direct you a live site of the project.
